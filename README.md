`math_lib.py`  contains python addition `add`  and division function `div`, updated to handle dividing by 0 and with added documentation

`calculate.py` contains a script that adds two numbers `a` and `b` together with `add`, and then divides these two numbers by a third number `c` using `div`.

usage of `calculate.py` is demonstrated in the `run.sh` file, and looks like this: `python calculate.py -a 1 -b 2 -c 3`
